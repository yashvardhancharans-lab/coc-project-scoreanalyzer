# coc-project-scoreanalyzer
This C program first asks the user how many student scores they want to input.
It then saves all those scores in an array.
After that, the program calculates three key results:

* The average score of the class

* The maximum score

* The minimum score

It uses loops to take the inputs and separate functions to find the average, highest, and lowest scores.
Overall, this program demonstrates how to use arrays, loops, and functions in C to perform basic data analysis.
